## About project

This is a manual for the commissioning of the **ABB IRC5C** controller's integrated vision with the **COGNEX 700** camera.

This is a detailed walkthrough of how to configure the camera on the controller **(in Spanish)** with a small example of part sorting using the part location and shape capabilities from the intefrated vision on a production line.
